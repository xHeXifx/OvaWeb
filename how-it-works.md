# How Ova Chat Works â€“ Developer Overview

This document explains in detail how ts works ^w^

---

## Backend (`app.py`)

- **Framework:** Flask
- **LLM:** Groq via LangChain (`ChatGroq`)
- **Memory:** Per-conversation memory using `ConversationBufferMemory`
- **Persistence:** User configs and chat histories stored as JSON files on disk
- **Profile Pictures:** Uploaded and stored in `/static` as `pfp_user_{user_id}.jpg` or `.gif`

### Key Endpoints

- `/chat`: Receives user message, generates response, updates history
- `/get_conversations`: Returns all conversations for a user
- `/save_config` & `/get_config`: Manage user settings (username, system prompt)
- `/get_users`: Lists all users with profile pictures
- `/upload_pfp`: Handles profile picture upload
- `/delete_conversation/<id>`: Deletes a conversation
- `/cleanup_memory/<id>`: Removes in-memory conversation state

### Conversation Flow

1. On message, loads/creates a `ConversationChain` for the conversation.
2. Uses user's system prompt and username in the prompt template.
3. Stores messages and memory buffer in JSON.
4. For new conversations, generates a short title using the LLM.

## Frontend (`templates/index.html`)

- **UI:** Sidebar for conversations, main chat area, modals for settings and deletion
- **User Selection:** Overlay for picking/creating user profiles
- **Chat:** Animated message rendering, Markdown/code support, typing effect
- **Settings:** Modal for editing username, system prompt, and uploading profile picture

### JavaScript Structure

- **User Management:** Loads users, handles selection, supports guest/new user
- **Conversation Management:** Loads/saves conversations, deletes, starts new chat
- **Message Rendering:** `createMessage` and `typeMessage` functions handle animated display and Markdown parsing
- **Settings Modal:** Loads/saves config, handles profile picture preview/upload
- **Quick Actions:** Buttons on welcome screen pre-fill input for common tasks

### Customization Points

- **Typing Speed:** `typeMessage` function, change delay in `setTimeout`
- **Default Prompts/Usernames:** Change in backend (`app.py`) or frontend modal defaults
- **UI Styles:** All CSS in `<style>` block at top of HTML

---

## Data Storage

- **User Config:** `config_user_{user_id}.json`
- **Chat History:** `chat_history_{user_id}.json`
- **Profile Pictures:** `/static/pfp_user_{user_id}.jpg` or `.gif`

---

## Adding Features

- To add new quick actions, edit the welcome screen HTML.
- To support more file types for profile pictures, update the allowed extensions in `app.py` (`upload_pfp` route).
- To change the LLM model, modify `model_name` in `app.py`.

---

## Security Notes

- No authentication; users are identified by profile selection.
- All data is stored locally; not suitable for production without further security.

---

## File Overview

- `app.py`: Flask backend, LLM integration, user/conversation management
- `templates/index.html`: UI, JavaScript logic, CSS
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Note

- Admittedly i did get AI to write this markdown file.. as i havent worked on ts for ages i dont fully remember how the flow works and it was just easier to chuck it to an AI instead of reading through the entire flow and writing ts. Forgive me ðŸ˜­
